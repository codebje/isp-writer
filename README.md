Branch [ymodem-patch](tree/ymodem-patch) patches YModem in the [TRS-20 bootrom](../trs20-bootrom/tree/v20200727.01) v20200727.01. There are several errors in that revision, but none so serious that code cannot be uploaded to the device.

The master branch loads in CP/M 2.2 with a BIOS, patched to do warm boots from RAM instead of from ROM.
